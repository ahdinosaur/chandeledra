## design

each edge has 3 [CN-601A](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/3Pcs-CN-601A-1m-16mmx16mm-LED-Aluminum-Channel-System-w-Cover-for-LED-Strip/PRD67I4N8FXE8O8) channels.

![CN-601A diagram](./images/CN-601A-diagram.jpg)

each edge of the polyhedron will be 3 aluminum led channels in parallel.

each vertex will connect respective edges using a 3d-printed structure (for example, a vertex connecting 3 edges will connect 9 channels).
